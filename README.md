1. Download or clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mariusroyale/wot-mods.git

2. Navigate to the hangar_clock folder:
   ```bash
   cd wot-mods/hangar_clock
   ```

3. Copy the contents into your World of Tanks mods directory for version 1.29.0.0:

    Example path on Windows:

    ```bash
    C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\1.29.0.0\
    ```

    Final structure should look like:
    ```bash

## 🧩 Notes

Only tested with the official game client.

You can safely remove the mod by deleting its files from the mods/1.29.0.0/ folder.
